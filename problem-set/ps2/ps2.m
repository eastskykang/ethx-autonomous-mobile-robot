% There are several possible answers to this so the check
% is based on the stacked wheel equations.

% Wheel 1, the far right wheel
alpha1 = 0;
beta1 = 0;
ell1 = 1/2;


% Wheel 1, the top left wheel
alpha2 = 2/3 * pi();
beta2 = 0;
ell2 = 1/2;
      

% Wheel 3, the bottom left wheel
alpha3 = 4/3 * pi();
beta3 = 0; 
ell3 = 1/2;
